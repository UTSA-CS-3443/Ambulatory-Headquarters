To play the game:
1. Once in the actual game you have the ability to move and attack with your selected units. To select an ally, just click on them. Then      to move, click on an open block. If there is a problem with the move, it will be displayed in the notifications box.
2. To attack, select a ally and then click on an enemy. If the enemy is within range it will automatically do damage.  If there is a     problem with the move, it will be displayed in the notifications box.

How to win:

To win the level you have to get as many of your characters to the end zones as possible, marked by the headquarter buildings within 100 turns. The next level will only appear once all allys are either dead or have entered the blue win zone. If a ally dies but another ally has already entered the win zone, the next level will still continue, but the dead allys will not be available. Once all 5 levels are beated in the same process, you win the game.

How to lose:

To lose the game you have to fail to get all alive characters to the blue win zones within 100 turns. Additionally you can lose the game by having each of your 3 characters die. If you have some characters in the blue end zone but fail to get all allys to it within 100 turns, you will still lose the game.
